## Parameters We can Change 
1. [[#Beam steering]]

#### Beam Steering 
**Beam steering** is a technique for changing the direction of the **main lobe** of a **radiation pattern**
- It can be achieved by ==switching the antenna elements or by changing the relative phases of the RF Signals driving the elements== 
- This helps to direct the the transmitted signal to the  receiver.

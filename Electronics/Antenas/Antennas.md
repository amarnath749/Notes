# Antennas
>[!float|right-small]
> - [[Building an Antenna]]



When fed by a transmitter with RF current (usually through a transmission line), the antenna
launches electromagnetic waves into the space.
- an antenna can transmit as well as receive signals(reciprocity
$$
\lambda_{meters} = \frac{279.7925}{f_{hertz}} \times 10^6 \tag{meter/sec ->(1)} 
$$



"When circuit dimensions are small compared to $\lambda$, most of the electromagnetic energy is confined to the circuit itself, and is used up either performing useful work or is converted into heat. However, when the dimensions of wiring or components become significant compared with the wavelength, some of the energy escapes by radiation in the form of electromagnetic waves"[^1]
